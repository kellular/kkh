### My name is Kelli Ho. I was born and raised in Honolulu, left for college in Seattle, and now live in Austin, where I'm a product designer at IBM. Primarily, I work on the IBM Support experience, but I also help to manage the design recruiting and application process within my business unit.

#### Where I shine
- **Detail, details, details**

I sweat the small stuff, but

- **Organization**

From naming folders and files in Box to placing furniture and accessories in my home, I believe everything has its place. I'm able to think better when things are systematically organized, and if they're not, I work to create a space that is.

- think before i speak

#### Where I'm looking to grow
- Insight and understanding of business decisions
- Technical scope in terms of functionality
- Prototyping in code
- Contributing to production code

#### Who I'm looking to work with
- People empathetic toward mental illness and how it can sometimes affect a teammate's job performance
- People who push me to become a better, compassionate human
