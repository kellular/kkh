  <!-- I have been conflicted with my own identity for a long time now. These feelings have gotten more complicated after I moved away from Hawai'i and settled in Texas.

On the outset, I look East Asian, but I'm not from East Asia. I was born here, in the U.S., along with my mom and dad. All three of us were born in Hawai'i, an extremely unique and special place much different from the mainland U.S.

However, my experiences as an Asian-American are much different than that of Asian-Americans who grew up in the U.S. mainland. In Hawai'i, most of my classmates were also Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, or a mix of multiple races.

I've been wanting to write this for awhile but did not have the words or understanding to do so. I still don't.

At that time, I was starting to feel an uncomfortable awareness of my race that I had not felt before. I grew up in Hawai'i,

I am Chinese, Hawaiian, and Causasian. I look ambiguous to people everywhere I go, including my home state.

My mom is full-Chinese. Her mom immigrated from China
and growing up, I remember her side of the family commenting  being "too brown", "too hairy", and


and how different I looked compared to those around me. White people were everywhere.

beginning to feel how out of place I looked whenever I walked down the street or into a restaurant with my White boyfriend. -->

  <p>I was never conscious of my “Asianness” growing up because I didn’t have to be. Most, if not all, of my friends and classmates were the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of immigrants, people who left everything they knew, and moved from China, Japan, the Philippines, to start a new life in Hawai‘i.</p>

  <p>It was only until I left the islands for the mainland that I’ve been met with curious and pointed questions about where I’m from. Because I don’t “look like an American”, people have prodded for the answers they want to hear: that I’m actually from China, or Japan, or Korea. For years, it made me feel self-conscious, defensive, irritated to find that a lot of people did not recognize nor accept a Chinese-Hawaiian as an American. I didn’t want to look like me.</p>

  <p>Recently, though, I have stopped giving a shit about the assumptions and accusations people have. White is not the only kind of American, but for too long, it has been the default.</p>
