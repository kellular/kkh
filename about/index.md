#### Hi there! My name is Kelli Ho. I was born and raised in Honolulu, left for college in Seattle, and now live in Austin, where I'm a product designer at IBM. Primarily, I work on the IBM Support experience, but I also help to manage the design recruiting and application process within my business unit.

This year I have been focused on understanding the intersection of the business and product design, growing my prototyping skills, and learning the technical environment behind software.
