#### Hi there! My name is Kelli Ho. I was born and raised in Honolulu, left for college in Seattle, and now live in Austin, where I'm a product designer at IBM.

This year I've been focused on understanding the intersection between the business and product design, growing my prototyping skills, and learning the technical environment behind software.
