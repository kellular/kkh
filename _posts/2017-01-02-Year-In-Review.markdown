title: "2016 Year in Review"
---

1. January
I started my second year with IBM Design, which also meant this year was my second living in Austin, TX.

At IBM this month, I continued giving my talk on defining vision to the winter Maelstrom interns. I ended up sharing this talk with the next two Maelstrom groups that followed.

I also turned 24.

2. February
I returned to Seattle for my very first recruiting trip for IBM! It was an extremely odd feeling to now be on the other side of table and talk with students looking for a career post-college. It was only a little more than a year ago where I was in their shoes. I never, ever want to forget this feeling of uncertainty yet hunger to pursue, learn, and create.

Another humbling experience for me at IBM this month was the opportunity to mentor a Maelstrom project. I remember feeling terrified and unsure of my credibility to lead. A big thing I learned is that mentorship skill takes time, growth, self-reflection, and failures. Fortunately I have a few people at IBM who believe in me, and I was able to lead two more Maelstrom projects after this first one.

A small personal piece of news from February is that my boyfriend, Matthew, gave me my first big plant -- a beautiful rubber tree named Bob. He's almost one-years-old!

5. May
I started (and unsuccessfully did not complete) a Daily Composition project where I spent one hour every day for two weeks creating a composition using basic shapes and color. I submitted one of these compositions to Cotton Bureau (my first time ever) and it ended up going to print.

7. July
I met up with my parents, aunty, and popo for a wedding in Los Angeles. A cousin in our extended family was getting married.

A few weeks later I traveled to Toronto for the first time! This trip was my first "real" work trip where it was actually for a workshop rather than a conference or recruiting.

8. August
After a little more than a year on my first product team at IBM, it felt like it was time to move on. On August 1 I started working in a different department within a team that worked remote. Part of my reason for switching was to move to New York City in early 2017.

9. September
Matthew attended the Github Conference in San Francisco for work so I tagged along and worked remotely there. It was around this time that I started feeling more anxiety than normal. A severe gag reflex also developed and would be triggered by public restrooms, or certain smells like car exhaust. I realized I was working for too long and stressing myself out over taking on too much work.

I got my first tattoo! It was done by the Paris-based illustrator, Anna Wanda Gogusey, who was doing flash tattoos in Austin.

10. October
My anxiety got a little better after I started forcing myself to close my laptop at 5 PM. It also helped to be more honest with my manager, peers, and mentors that I was overwhelmed. My doctor prescribed me anxiety medication and a stomach acid reducer, which immensely helped with the strange gag reflex I was experiencing.

This month I was also working on a piece for an art show I was asked to participate in. The show's theme was on self-identity. Over the course of this year I

Towards the end of October, Matthew and I traveled to Europe for a 10-day vacation! We visited Paris, Berlin, and Prague.

Shortly after I returned, I flew to New York City for a work meeting. I met my remote teammates IRL for the first time. While in the city, my friend Raven convinced me to buy a pair of sparkly gold pants from one of our favorite stores. A year ago I would never have considered buying them. However, throughout our two-year friendship, Raven has inspired and encouraged a great deal of self-confidence in myself. So I bought them and wore them for the first time on the last day of 2016.

11. November
Voted for the first time. Proudly voted for Hillary Clinton. When this year first started, I did not fully understand what feminism, much less intersectional feminism, was. It was through a lot of reading from and listening to women of color that I was able to form a better perspective for myself. This perspective is still forming, and I plan to develop it more actively this year. One way in which I plan to do this is to be more aware of what I consume: books written by marginalized people, movies and TV shows starring more marginalized people. 

12. December
I went home to Hawai'i for the holidays, and this year I brought Matthew. This was his first trip to Hawai'i and I am so happy I was able to experience it with him.
